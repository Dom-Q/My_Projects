Personal Projects :
-------------------
-> Linux-style Kernel
  - Fully functional OS complete with filesystem, virtual memory, context switching and scheduling, system calls, exceptions, and interrupts.

-> Air Traffic Graph
  - Graph Data Structure that contains data on all of the world's airports, airlines, and flight routes. The program can return any of the data based on user input and also can draw any airport or flight route on the map projection provided. All data was gathered from OpenFlight. 

-> Song Recommendation and Playlist Generator
  - Creates a playlist on the user's account and uses a simple decision tree to fill the playlist with songs that the user may like based on their listening data. Data is gathered from the Spotify API.
  
-> Route Cipher Encryption/Decryption
  - Reads a file whose title is given by user. The contents of the file are then encrypted by shifting all characters in the file a random amount of times along one of several "routes" within a matrix with random dimensions. The encrypted text is written to a new file which can be given as input back to the program to be decrypted if the user knows the proper keys.
