Personal Projects :
-------------------
-> Song Recommendation and Playlist Generator
  - Creates a playlist on the user's account and uses a simple decision tree to fill the playlist with songs that the user may like based on their listening data. Data is gathered from the Spotify API.
  
-> Route Cipher Encryption/Decryption
  - Reads a file whose title is given by user. The contents of the file are then encrypted by shifting all characters in the file a random amount of times along one of several "routes" within a matrix with random dimensions. The encrypted text is written to a new file which can be given as input back to the program to be decrypted if the user knows the proper keys.
  
-> Balanced Binary Search Tree
  - Binary Search Tree data structure that maintains its balance. Initialized with a sorted array of numbers and contains functions for all features to insert, delete, traverse, access, set, and read information about the tree and its nodes.
