---------------

1.) 
    Error: Keyboard sending same char 
    Duration: 1-2 Hours

2.) 
    Error: Keyboard unable to send multiple charachters
    Duration: 1-2 Hours
    Solution: Same as above

3.)
    Error: Keyboard printing random 'c' charachter in between typed charachters
    Duration: 20-30 min
    Solution: Key codes being received that were out of bounds of char array; prevent processor from reading these in

4.) 
    Error: Protection fault when typing multiple keys simultaneously 
    Duration: Unsolved
    Suspected Solution: RTC issue

5.)
    Error: RTC crashing kernel
