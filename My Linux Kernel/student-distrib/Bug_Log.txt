MP 3.1 Bug Log
---------------

1) 
    Error: Keyboard sending same char 
    Duration: 1-2 Hours
    Solution: Reading value from wrong port, initially thought we needed to read from PIC port but actually needed to read from 0x60

2) 
    Error: Keyboard unable to send multiple charachters
    Duration: 1-2 Hours
    Solution: Same as above

3)
    Error: Keyboard printing random 'c' charachter in between typed charachters
    Duration: 20-30 min
    Solution: Key codes being received that were out of bounds of char array; prevent processor from reading these in

4) 
    Error: Protection fault when typing multiple keys simultaneously 
    Duration: Unsolved
    Suspected Solution: RTC issue

5)
    Error: RTC crashing kernel
    Duration: 1-2 Hours
    Solution: Send_EOI implemented incorrectly
